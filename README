-Purpose: Test of Python 2.7 and PyGame(1.7)
-Time Spent Working: 12hrs

-Requirements: Python 2.7 and PyGame 1.7
-Features: Mouse control, high scores, sounds, textbox, images, King of the Hill themed.

-Move your mouse rapidly to collect the boxes in order to gain points. 

-Highscores are stored locally in cleverly named .hamaad files
-font.hamaad uses cPickle to store high score numbers.
-sound.hamaad uses cPickle to store high score names.

-Cheat code: It will give you 200 more boxes, and a Hank Hill cursor.
-Type 'rimsha' in any order (arhsmi, for example) to activate the cheat.
-For the source, type 'bomhauer' in any order to activate the cheat.

-Press enter to pause the music, and to start playing it again.

-After entering your name, you will be shown a instructions screen(4 seconds.)
-You cannot do anything in this screen but wait; you cannot unpause music.

-There is a System_Files Editor file.
-This will allow you to edit the highscores to your liking.

-This project is currently DONE.
